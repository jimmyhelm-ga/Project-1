Ember: A 20th Century Campfire Simulation
Ember is a simple web application that simulates a campfire experience. Users can interact with the fire, stoking it, writing poems, and even entering a "serenity mode" for a more immersive experience. The simulation runs for 60 seconds, after which the fire goes out and the user can start again.

How to Use
Starting the Fire: Click on the "Start Fire" button to begin the simulation. This will display the fire animation, start the countdown timer, and enable interaction buttons.

Stoking the Fire: Click on the "Stoke Fire" button to stoke the fire. This will intensify the flame and reset the timer to 60 seconds.

Entering Serenity Mode: Click on the "Serenity Mode" button to immerse yourself in the experience. This hides certain elements like the timer and allows you to focus on the fire animation.

Exiting Serenity Mode: While in Serenity Mode, you can exit by clicking the "Exit Serenity Mode" button. This brings back the interaction buttons and timer.

Writing Poems: Click on the "Write Poem" button to clear the text area and start writing your poem. The text area allows you to jot down your thoughts or creative expressions.

Putting Out the Fire: Click on the "Put Out Fire" button to extinguish the fire. This ends the simulation and prompts you to start again.

Starting Again: If the fire goes out or you want to start over, click on the "The Fire Went Out. Click Here to Start Again." button.

Technical Details
The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses event listeners to handle user interactions and manipulates the DOM to update the display dynamically. The countdown timer is implemented using JavaScript intervals.
